# Naming and frontmatter

## Files and folders

- Lowercase kebab-case throughout. No spaces, no underscores, no capitals.
- Work items: `wiki/work/NNNN-kebab-slug/`. Four digits, zero-padded, next unused number, never
  reused.
- Phase artifacts inside a work item keep their fixed names and numeric prefixes: `00-research.md`,
  `01-plan.md`, `02-criteria.md`, `03-tasks.md`, `04-product-contract.md`. The `04` prefix is a
  stable filename, not the order of writing: the product contract is written in the plan phase,
  before the plan is finalized.
- Solution files: `wiki/solutions/YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-slug.md`. The date is the day the learning was
  written.
- The product goal, when it exists: `wiki/product/GOAL.md`.
- Validation reports: `validation/<phase>-review-NN.md`, where `<phase>` is `research`, `plan` or
  `impl`, and `NN` starts at `01` and increments per round. Never overwrite a prior round.
- ADRs: `wiki/adr/NNNN-kebab-title.md`. Four digits, sequential, never reused, never deleted.

## Identifiers

- Acceptance criteria: `AC-001` upward, unique within a work item, never renumbered once frozen.
  Each cites the requirement it checks.
- Requirements: `R-001` upward, in `04-product-contract.md`, never renumbered.
- Actors `A-001`, flows `F-001`, acceptance examples `AE-001`, same file, never renumbered.
- Success checks: `SC-001` upward, in `wiki/product/GOAL.md`, never renumbered.
- Plan units: `U1`, `U2`, in headings of the form `### U1. Name`. Never renumbered. A deletion
  leaves a gap. A split keeps the original number and takes the next unused number for the new unit.
- Findings in a validation report: `F-001` upward, unique within that report.
- A task in `03-tasks.md` cites the unit and the criteria it satisfies by ID. A task satisfying no
  criterion does not belong in the plan.

## Headings

Headings are link targets. Once a document is referenced, its headings are part of its contract —
reword the body, not the heading. If a heading must change, update every reference in the same
commit.

## Frontmatter

Every document under `wiki/` except work-item artifacts and `templates/STATE.yaml` carries this YAML
frontmatter:

| Field           | Required | Meaning                                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | yes      | Stable kebab-case identifier, unique across the wiki. Never changes.                    |
| `title`         | yes      | Human-readable title.                                                                   |
| `status`        | yes      | `active`, `draft`, or `superseded`.                                                     |
| `owner`         | yes      | Person or team accountable. `unassigned` is allowed but is a known gap.                 |
| `last_verified` | yes      | ISO date the content was last checked against reality. Not the last edit date.          |
| `applies_to`    | yes      | Glob list naming the code this document governs. `["**"]` for project-wide.             |
| `summary`       | yes      | One sentence. This is what a router or an agent reads before deciding to open the file. |
| `supersedes`    | no       | `id` of the document this one replaces.                                                 |
| `superseded_by` | no       | `id` of the document that replaced this one. Set alongside `status: superseded`.        |

Work-item artifacts carry no frontmatter — their folder and filename already encode everything.
`STATE.yaml` is the work item's metadata.

## Superseding

Documents are never deleted. To retire one: set `status: superseded`, set `superseded_by`, and set
`supersedes` on the replacement. The old document stays in place and stays reachable from the index.
Deleting it destroys the record of why the project once believed something else.

## Staleness

`last_verified` older than 180 days on an `active` document is a lint warning. Older than 365 days
is a lint failure. Re-verify the content or mark the document superseded; do not touch the date
without re-reading the content.
